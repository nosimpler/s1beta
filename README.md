# s1beta

s1beta contains NEURON/Python code for simulating the effects of 15--29Hz beta events on MEG evoked responses in primary somatosensory cortex (SI). This is essentially a fork of the original s1beta code written by Shane Lee and Max Sherman, based from Stephanie Jones's original SI model. 

Note that this model has been reimplemented as part of the [Human Neocortical Neurosolver](https://hnn.brown.edu/) project, and it is likely much easier to play around with it using the tutorial [here](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/auto_examples/workflows/plot_simulate_beta.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-workflows-plot-simulate-beta-py).
